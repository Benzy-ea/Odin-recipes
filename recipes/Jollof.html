<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Per-boil the rice</strong> by boiling the rice for a few minutes -- not fully boiled-- before upending
        it in a seive to drain.</li>
    <li><strong>Wash the rice</strong> by placing the perboiled rice in a bowl of water and slowly-- using your hands or
        preferably a smaller seive-- scooping the rice into another bowl without water until you can see the bottom.
        This is to get rid of stone particles that may have settled at the bottom.</li>
    <li>Pour oil into the pot in proportion to the rice perboiled</li>
    <li>Pour blended pepper into the oil. <em>If you dont already have blended pepper, no need to worry. Pick a few and
            blend it.</em></li>
    <li>Pour sliced onions into the hot oil</li>
    <li>Pour Tomato in proportion to the rice into the oil</li>
    <li>Stir for a few minutes</li>
    <li>Pour boiled meat water into the fried Tomato in proportion to the Tomato and rice</li>
    <li>Pour rice into the Tomato and Meat water</li>
    <li>Stir slightly</li>
    <li>Close pot for a 5 minutes</li>
    <p><em>make sure water covers the surface of the rice just slightly</em></p>
    <li>After the 5 minutes is up pour sliced green pepper</li>
    <li>Leave to cook</li>
    <li>Check after 15-25 minutes</li>
    <li>If rice tastes properly cooked --soft-- turn the rice with a wooden spoon from the bottom of the pot.</li>
    <li>Allow to steam for 3 minutes after adding carrots and green peas</li>
    <li>Your jollof is ready.</li>
